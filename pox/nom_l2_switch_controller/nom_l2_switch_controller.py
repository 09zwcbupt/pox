"""
This is a prototype control application written on top of the (substrate) NOM. 

It demonstrates that there are a lot of design decisions to be made.. In particular,
it seems there is a tension between the constraints of order-independence (the
application should keep no state of its own, therefore all state should be
stored in the NOM) and the need to hide the details of the lower layers of the
NOM functionality (e.g. pox.openflow.topology) from the application developer.

So,
- Should the application developer define custom NOM entities within their own
  modules, or at a lower layer? 
- If in their own module, how do we get the lower layers
  (i.e. pox.openflow.topology) to instantiate the custom  NOM entity rather
  than the default (i.e. OpenFlowSwitch)
- Should we provide a generic mechanism for users to define custom NOM entities 
  from their own module? For example, we could allow them to add handlers via
  python reflection foo to the default NOM entities.

More thoughts inline.

      The learning switch "brain". 
  
      When we see a packet, we'd like to output it on a port which will join_eventually
      lead to the destination.  To accomplish this, we build a table that maps
      addresses to ports.
  
      We populate the table by observing traffic.  When we see a packet from some
      source coming from some port, we know that source is out that port.
  
      When we want to forward traffic, we look up the destination in our table.  If
      we don't know the port, we simply send the message out all ports except the
      one it came in on.  (In the presence of loops, this is bad!).
  
      In short, our algorithm looks like this:
  
      For each new flow:
      1) Use source address and port to update address/port table
      2) Is destination multicast?
         Yes:
            2a) Flood the packet
         No:
            2b) Port for destination address in our address/port table?
               No:
                 2ba) Flood the packet
              Yes:
                 2bb1) Install flow table entry in the switch so that this flow
                       goes out the appopriate port
                 2bb2) Send buffered packet out appopriate port
  
      Handles PacketIn messages from the switch to implement above algorithm.
