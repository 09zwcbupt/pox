pox.py boots up pox. It takes a list of module names on the command line,
locates the modules, calls their launch() methods, and then opens up a command
line prompt allowing you to interact with the modules interactively.

Module names can be fully specified, or abbreviated to just the top level
directory name under pox/ or ext/. For example, the following to invocations
are equivalent:

  ./pox.py pox.dumb_l2_switch

  ./pox.py dump_l2_switch

You can pass options to the modules by specifying options after the module
name. For example, to set the address or port of the controller, invoke
as follows:

  ./pox.py of_01 --address=10.1.1.1 --port=6634

pox.py also supports a few command line options of its own:
 --verbose
 --no-cli
 --no-openflow
