POX is a network controller written in Python.

POX requires Python 2.7, and should run under Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.
You can place a pypy distribution alongside in pox.py (in a directory
named "pypy"), and POX will run with pypy (this can be a significant
performance boost!).

POX communicates with OpenFlow 1.0 switches.

pox.py boots up POX. It takes a list of module names on the command line,
locates the modules, calls their launch() function (if it exists), and
then opens up a Python commandline for interactive use.

The "pox" and "ext" directories are added to the Python path, so you can
specify modules in either one without qualification.  For example:

  ./pox.py dumb_l2_switch

You can pass options to the modules by specifying options after the module
name.  These are passed to the module's launch() funcion.  For example,
to set the address or port of the controller, invoke as follows:

  ./pox.py of_01 --address=10.1.1.1 --port=6634

pox.py also supports a few command line options of its own:
 --verbose      print stack traces for initialization exceptions
 --no-cli       don't bring up a command line prompt
 --no-openflow  don't boot pox.openflow automatically
